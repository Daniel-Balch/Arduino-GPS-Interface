# Arduino-GPS-Interface
I started this Arduino-GPS Interface project for my undergraduate-level embedded systems course. The goal of the project is to be able to communicate with an Adafruit 
GPS Breakout v3 chip interface using the Arduino Uno. Specifically, I wanted to be able to send packets to adjust the settings on the GPS, and receive and parse GPS data. The parsed data would then be sent to a 16x2 LCD display that comes with many Arduino kits. All code meant for the Arduino was written in C. In addition to two versions of my main program, I also wrote several small programs to test functions and algorithms for use in my main program, as well as a few Java programs to generate long switch statements used for writing characters to the display. More details on the project can be found on my Wiki page for this project.
